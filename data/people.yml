  talk_title: "Cats, The Musical! Algorithmic Song Meow-ification"
  talk_abstract: "How are you supposed to sing along with your favorite TV theme song every week if it doesn't have lyrics? At my house, we 'meow' along (loudly). We also code, so I built 'Meowifier' to convert any song into a cat's meows. Join me in this exploration of melody analysis APIs and gratuitous cat gifs. I built an application that takes a song's audio and outputs a new audio file with that song's melody **sung by cats**. It's a technical feat. It's hilarious. It's beautiful. It's a new way to waste time on the internet."

  talk_title: "Understanding Layout"
  talk_abstract: "The web finally has a true system for layout baked into CSS — with the combination of Grid, Flexbox, Multicolumn, Flow, Writing Modes, Alignment, Sizing, and more. But what does this mean? How can we understand the whole system, not just the bits and pieces of code syntax. How can designers invent a new layout for each project, not just draw 12-column wireframes based on limitations from a decade ago. There are hundreds of ways to learn `display: flex;`, but very few that truly explain what’s happening. We have the chance to get deeply creative, if we could only Understand Layout. There will be very little code in this workshop — it’s perfect for both designers and developers, newbies and those with experience. Come learn an overall understanding of how web page layout works now that everything has changed."

Sometimes it’s just a necessary evil. Sometimes it can even be done artfully. Let’s talk about how to fail a bit less, fail less painfully, and fail more strategically."

Using The Gendered Project (a library of gendered words) as a case study, she’ll take the audience through the process of creating a dataset using popular libraries for data analysis and processing in Python — NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit), Panda, Gensim and techniques like regular expressions."
