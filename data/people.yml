  talk_title: "Understanding Layout"
  talk_abstract: "The web finally has a true system for layout baked into CSS — with the combination of Grid, Flexbox, Multicolumn, Flow, Writing Modes, Alignment, Sizing, and more. But what does this mean? How can we understand the whole system, not just the bits and pieces of code syntax. How can designers invent a new layout for each project, not just draw 12-column wireframes based on limitations from a decade ago. There are hundreds of ways to learn `display: flex;`, but very few that truly explain what’s happening. We have the chance to get deeply creative, if we could only Understand Layout. There will be very little code in this workshop — it’s perfect for both designers and developers, newbies and those with experience. Come learn an overall understanding of how web page layout works now that everything has changed."
