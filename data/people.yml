  talk_title: "The Fallacy of Exporting Tech Solutions to the Middle East"
  talk_abstract: "Regional innovators are bucking the notion that Western
  imported tech is the solution to the Middle East's problems. Music, creative
  ways to bypass censorship, and grassroots literacy are the real paths to
  change, and are being forged by innovators already in the region: they just
  need partners brave enough to join them."

  largest library systems in the world"
  talk_abstract: "Many people depend on the public library, and as one of the
  largest library systems in the world, building for the New York Public Library
  requires a lot of careful navigation of bureaucracy, a deep empathy of the
  diverse users that rely on the library, and the technical chops to get the job
  done. Courteney shares her journey of building an e-library card for the
  library and the lessons she learned in the process."

  talk_title: "Incognito Mentorship"
  talk_abstract: "It's no wonder that you feel stuck and overwhelmed in your
  coding journey. There's just too much. Too much to learn, too much to know.
  Too many unknowns, too many resources, too many options. This talk explores how to get the mentorship you need, and you may be
  surprised to discover that this is not the same thing as the mentorship you

  talk_title: "Open source governance 101: What it really takes to maintain an open source project"
  talk_abstract: "Running a successful open source project is just as much, if
  not more, of a social task as a technical one. The combination of technical
  and social skills required can seem very intimidating at first. The good new
  is that all these skills can be learned. Learn how to tell when a project is
  ready to be open sourced (hint: it‚Äôs more than throwing it on Github),
  publicizing your project, reviewing pull requests, kindly saying ‚Äúno‚Äù when a
  pull request isn‚Äôt the right direction for a project, creating and managing
  versioned releases, and more."

  talk_title: "The Good Bad Bug: Learning to Embrace Mistakes"
  talk_abstract: "The history of programming is filled with examples of bugs
  that actually turned out to be features and limitations that pushed developers
  to make an even more interesting product. We‚Äôll journey through code that was
  so ‚Äòbad‚Äô it was actually good. Then we‚Äôll learn to tame our inner
  perfectionists so our code will be even better than it is today."
