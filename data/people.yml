  talk_type: "talk"

They used machine learning to optimize completion time and accuracy.

He was so caught up in the details that it took months to see it would be used
to kill people. What do we do when we discover that we're building something
immoral or unethical? How can we think through the uses of our software to avoid
this problem entirely?"

In recent years, many developers didn’t even try — we outsource the pain to frameworks like Bootstrap instead. Designers have gotten stuck thinking every website should use the same 12 column grid. Developers are fixed on specific coding techniques as being the only correct ones. Well, everything just changed. 

With CSS Grid and many other new specifications, CSS has matured into a powerful
toolset for graphic design. And newbies are at an advantage. New designers have
a fresh eye. New developers don’t have to unlearn bad habits. Hiring managers
need people who have these skills. Everyone is just getting started. For a
