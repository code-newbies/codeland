  talk_title: "Yes, You Should Write That Blog Post"
  talk_abstract: "Writing your first — or your hundredth — blog post is a challenge. What if nobody reads your post? Or someone leaves a rude comment? Or you get a technical detail wrong? And, how do you feel confident enough to press the publish button? Ali has navigated all these situations in the past year and a half that she’s been writing. She’ll tell her story and why she still writes and publishes technical blog posts."

  talk_title: "Cats, The Musical! Algorithmic Song Meow-ification"
  talk_abstract: "How are you supposed to sing along with your favorite TV theme song every week if it doesn't have lyrics? At my house, we 'meow' along (loudly). We also code, so I built 'Meowifier' to convert any song into a cat's meows. Join me in this exploration of melody analysis APIs and gratuitous cat gifs. I built an application that takes a song's audio and outputs a new audio file with that song's melody **sung by cats**. It's a technical feat. It's hilarious. It's beautiful. It's a new way to waste time on the internet."
