    "abstract": "I experienced burnout for the first time just within two years into my career as a software developer. If I could go back in time, and tell myself one thing, it would be ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay not to be okay‚Äù.\r\n\r\nStarting your first software development job is very rewarding. You get to apply what you learned from school, bootcamp, or self-learning to a product used by actual customers. At the same time, there are lots of opportunities to learn and grow.\r\n\r\nWhen I started my first job, I didn‚Äôt have much experience, I felt like a complete imposter. You could say it‚Äôs like being in a foggy place and defogging as you go, trying to prove you know your way around. I felt like any questions asked or any feedback given, could expose me as an imposter. It made saying \"I don't know‚Äù hard.\r\n\r\nA few months in, my lead went on their paternity leave, and my director left the company. I didn‚Äôt have anyone I could go to for support or guidance. I developed a few bad habits like comparing myself to others, and spending my off-time working. It was very unhealthy, and it led me to burning out. Some days, I would feel awesome, and other days, I would feel sad.\r\n\r\nNow with more years of experience under my belt, and being a mentor to others. This talk will cover how I burned out, strategies on how I take care of myself now, and why it's okay not to be okay.\r\n\r\nIn my talk, I will cover the following topics:\r\n- Dealing with imposter syndrome\r\n- Signs of burnout\r\n- Not giving yourself a break\r\n- Taking on more than you can handle\r\n- How to take care of yourself (personal boundaries)\r\n- Organizing your day, and setting core hours\r\n- Setting a goal on how to get better 1% a day.\r\n- Asking for constructive feedback\r\n- Starting a brag list to capture weekly wins!\r\n- Have social chats with others!\r\n- Support and guidance\r\n- It‚Äôs okay to say I don‚Äôt know\r\n\r\nImposter Syndrome is completely normal to have. As we gain more experience or change roles,  it definitely won‚Äôt be going away. We can reduce it, and accept it as a sign we are learning new things and growing. This is where my talk will focus on the strategies I used to reduce imposter syndrome. One of the key strategies I used is setting a 1% increment to be better daily. For example, am I getting less comments on my pull request? Or can I provide others context on how something I work on works? As well, by sharing how I structure my 1:1s with my lead, and interns to know how I am doing. I will also introduce rituals that I started in late 2020, which are capturing weekly wins, and daily positive affirmations. These rituals help me realize that I am growing, and allow me to reflect back to my accomplishments.\r\n\r\nAfter, my talk will move onto signs to look out for with burnout. I talked about how I burned out, and how I did not realize I was burning out until it was too late. I will share my strategies on how I do self-care such as having social chats, and setting core hours to prevent overworking.\r\n\r\nBy the end of my talk, I want the audience to walk away with strategies I used when dealing with burning out and imposter syndrome. This is definitely a difficult thing to talk to others with, but by sharing my story, I want to open up and let others know, it‚Äôs okay. This is all part of being 1% better a day that focuses on the process rather than the end goal.",
