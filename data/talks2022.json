Statistics and problems are currently there.\r\n•\tWhat is inclusivity? The difference between equity and equality.\r\n•\tWhat is web accessibility? \r\n•\tAccessibility in promoting inclusivity?

Guidelines that are there to help us achieve web accessibility\r\n•\tDeveloping for the margins to promote inclusivity. Ensuring that we include accessibility in our development process and always having inclusivity in mind.\r\n\r\nTalk Abstract\r\nStatistics show that currently, close to 15% of people are faced with some form of disability. By disability, I not only mean the permanent form of disability that we are used to but I also mean the temporary and situational kinds of disabilities. This means that many people cannot access our websites and web tools with real ease as others. It is therefore upon us to keep them in mind while developing. \r\nHowever, the tech world is now shifting gears and there is a rise of a new breed of developers. Self-taught developers. With the access to the internet and availability of online/virtual learning, many have sorted to that option to learn web development skills.  This is a good thing as it makes knowledge and skills development affordable and available. But the problem arises when key fundamental issues are not taught. Key things like accessibility.  This has led to the rise of so many websites and web tools that are awesome and good to the eye but just not easy to use for people with disabilities. These are people, like you and me but just with different levels of ability. They might be potential customers for you. They also need to use our websites and web tools for their day-to-day life. And building without accessibility in mind from the get-go just excludes them from whatever it is you are developing. \r\nTo solve this problem, web accessibility is crucial. It is very important to develop our websites and web tools with intention. Being intentional and deliberate in building for the margins. Ensuring that we include those who are usually excluded from the current websites and web tools. Building for the margins ensures we take everyone and their abilities into consideration. This makes sure the needs of everyone are catered for, a 'high tide lifts all boats' situation.\r\nThere are guidelines set in place to ensure that consider people with disabilities in the most optimal way. There are also easier ways to test and fix accessibility issues using various packages, extensions, and tools.\r\nAccessibility brings about inclusivity and lets those of us who are usually excluded feel cared for and considered. Let us advocate for accessibility and inclusivity. Accessibility is not a feature but a requirement. Let us be more intentional and deliberate in our development. Humanity is being empathetic and helping others   \r\n\r\n","format":"Talk","track":"Beyond the Binary","tags":[],"id":21,"video_url":null,"slides_url":null,"speakers":[{"name":"Clifford Ouma","bio":"Clifford Ouma is an undergrad student at Moi University in Kenya.

If I could go back in time, and tell myself one thing, it would be “it’s okay not to be okay”.\r\n\r\nStarting your first software development job is very rewarding. You get to apply what you learned from school, bootcamp, or self-learning to a product used by actual customers. At the same time, there are lots of opportunities to learn and grow.\r\n\r\nWhen I started my first job, I didn’t have much experience, I felt like a complete imposter. You could say it’s like being in a foggy place and defogging as you go, trying to prove you know your way around. I felt like any questions asked or any feedback given, could expose me as an imposter. It made saying \"I don't know” hard.\r\n\r\nA few months in, my lead went on their paternity leave, and my director left the company. I didn’t have anyone I could go to for support or guidance. I developed a few bad habits like comparing myself to others, and spending my off-time working. It was very unhealthy, and it led me to burning out. Some days, I would feel awesome, and other days, I would feel sad.\r\n\r\nNow with more years of experience under my belt, and being a mentor to others. This talk will cover how I burned out, strategies on how I take care of myself now, and why it's okay not to be okay.\r\n\r\nIn my talk, I will cover the following topics:\r\n- Dealing with imposter syndrome\r\n- Signs of burnout\r\n- Not giving yourself a break\r\n- Taking on more than you can handle\r\n- How to take care of yourself (personal boundaries)\r\n- Organizing your day, and setting core hours\r\n- Setting a goal on how to get better 1% a day.\r\n- Asking for constructive feedback\r\n- Starting a brag list to capture weekly wins!\r\n- Have social chats with others!\r\n- Support and guidance\r\n- It’s okay to say I don’t know\r\n\r\nImposter Syndrome is completely normal to have. As we gain more experience or change roles,  it definitely won’t be going away. We can reduce it, and accept it as a sign we are learning new things and growing. This is where my talk will focus on the strategies I used to reduce imposter syndrome. One of the key strategies I used is setting a 1% increment to be better daily. For example, am I getting less comments on my pull request? Or can I provide others context on how something I work on works? As well, by sharing how I structure my 1:1s with my lead, and interns to know how I am doing. I will also introduce rituals that I started in late 2020, which are capturing weekly wins, and daily positive affirmations. These rituals help me realize that I am growing, and allow me to reflect back to my accomplishments.\r\n\r\nAfter, my talk will move onto signs to look out for with burnout. I talked about how I burned out, and how I did not realize I was burning out until it was too late. I will share my strategies on how I do self-care such as having social chats, and setting core hours to prevent overworking.\r\n\r\nBy the end of my talk, I want the audience to walk away with strategies I used when dealing with burning out and imposter syndrome. This is definitely a difficult thing to talk to others with, but by sharing my story, I want to open up and let others know, it’s okay. This is all part of being 1% better a day that focuses on the process rather than the end goal.","format":"Talk","track":"Healthy Coding","tags":[],"id":27,"video_url":"","slides_url":"","speakers":[{"name":"Raymond Chung","bio":"Often mistaken as an intern, Raymond Chung is building a new generation of software developers through Shopify's Dev Degree program.
