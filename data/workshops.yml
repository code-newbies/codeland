  talk_abstract: |
    Home assignments are here to stay as they offer less biased views and are more focused on the quality of your work.
    
    Unfortunately, if you’re a Junior Developer, the quality of work is usually what stands out. Your projects won’t look like a professional reviewer is used to: They may be messy, half-working, or lacking documentation and instructions.

    Workshop participants will learn an organized system for working on a small project while presenting best-practices. That means passing more interview steps, more options to choose from, and more bargaining power for your next job.
  requirements: |
    Bring your own laptop and development environment. There will be some coding involved, make sure you’re all set-up, because we wouldn’t want to lose any time over it.

    This workshop is backend oriented, but language agnostic - You can use Python, NodeJS, Java - Whatever you’re comfortable with. This is not the time to experiment with new languages. The code won’t be the issue here.
    
    How proficient should you be? If you can write and understand what’s going on in a small web-server tutorial (i.e. Flask for Python, builtin HTTP for Node, Spring Bootstrap for Java).
    
    Install Docker and make sure it’s running.

  talk_abstract: |
    The web standard includes many APIs for an increasing range of tasks: controlling bluetooth, managing files, handling the clipboard… Some of them are more “serious,” and some of them are more “fun.” The Gamepad API falls in this last category. 

    It opens a world of possibilities for gaming by providing a different way to play games on the browser and by giving control to the users and creators. And its potential goes beyond gaming: adapted controllers could be used by people with disabilities, widening the possibilities and improving their access not only to games but to the Internet in general.

    In this workshop we will introduce the Gamepad API, explore how it works, and use it to build a game with HTML and JavaScript that can be played on the browser with a connected game controller.

In this workshop, open to all (no previous drawing experience required!) Denise will take you through the basics of tech-doodling. We'll load a few handy devices into our toolbox for depicting characters and emotions, learn how to create visual metaphors, and start telling stories about our craft.

  talk_title: "#YourTechStory: How to Showcase Your Story and Skills During Technical Interviews"
  talk_abstract: |
    The most common myth about technical interviews is that they only focus on your coding ability! In reality, technical interviews are about showing how your story and professional experiences will add value to a potential company, team and/or role. Translation: you need to highlight both your technical and soft skills to stand out from the pack!
    
    In this workshop, you will craft your story by 1) identifying the key skills recruiters are looking for at each stage of the interview process, 2) creating a memorable 30-second elevator pitch, 3) developing examples that show (and not just tell) the value you can add beyond your resume and 4) learning a framework that highlights your thought process during coding questions! Get ready to define and share #YourTechStory.

  talk_title: "Making NES Games in Assembly"
  talk_abstract: |
    When Nintendo released the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in the US in 1985, it quickly dominated the home video game market. Production of the NES ended in 1995, but it continues to be a popular platform, with several successful Kickstarter campaigns to fund the development of new NES games. Games for the NES are programmed in assembly, an extremely low-level programming language that gives the developer full control over the underlying hardware, but requires knowledge of how that hardware works. This means that learning assembly gives you insight into how computers in general interpret and execute programs, which can be applied to programming challenges in any other language.
    
    In this workshop we will explore assembly development for the NES in a modern context, using emulators to run the games that we will develop. By the end of the workshop, you'll be able to draw graphics to the screen and handle input from the controller, and you'll have plenty of resources to continue learning on your own.

  requirements: "The software that we will be using is all cost-free and cross-platform, please have the following three programs installed -  cc65, Nintaco, and NES Screen Tool."
