  <p>We will process your personal information lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner. We collect and process information about you only where we have legal bases for doing so.</p>
  <p>These legal bases depend on the services you use and how you use them, meaning we collect and use your information only where:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>itâ€™s necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract (for example, when we provide a service you request from us);</li>

    <li>you give us consent to do so for a specific purpose (for example, you might consent to us sending you our newsletter); or</li>
    <li>we need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Where you consent to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time (but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place).</p>
  <p>We donâ€™t keep personal information for longer than is necessary. While we retain this information, we will protect it within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification. That said, we advise that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure and cannot guarantee absolute data security. If necessary, we may retain your personal information for our compliance with a legal obligation or in order to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural person.</p>
  <h2 class="text-h3">3. Collection and use of information</h2>
  <p>We may collect, hold, use and disclose information for the following purposes and personal information will not be further processed in a manner that is incompatible with these purposes:</p>
