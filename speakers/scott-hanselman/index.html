        <h2>Solving Diabetes with an Open Source Artificial Pancreas
          <span class="program-list_item_type">talk</span>
        </h2>
        <p>Scott has been a Type 1 diabetic for nearly 25 years. When he first became diabetic he did what every engineer would do...he wrote an app to solve his problem. Fast forward to 2019 and Scott lives 24 hours a day connected to an open source artificial pancreas. After years of waiting, the diabetes community online creating solutions. Now the future of diabetes care is more promising than ever and open source (and open data standards) are making it possible.
Scott will go through the history of diabetes online, the components (both hardware and software) needed for an artificial pancreas, and discuss the architectural design of two popular systems (LoopKit and OpenAPS). We’ll also learn how social networking can influence national health policy. Plus, you'll see Scott *not die* live on stage as he's been "looping" for over a year!</p>
