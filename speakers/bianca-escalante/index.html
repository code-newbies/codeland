      <h2>Open Source for ...Bad?
        <span class="program-list_item_type">talk</span>
      </h2>
      <p>We spend a lot of time talking about Open Source for Good but what about Open Source for Bad? It's easy to believe that open source is naturally 'good' because it's 'free' and 'open', but this powerful tool can be used for ill-advised reasons too. As contributors, we have the ability to shape the role that open source plays in helping to move humankind forward. Let's discuss how to do that and what that looks like. With Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning developing at a faster rate than many of us could have imagined, it's invaluable to examine how technology can be used for negative reasons.</p>
