## CodeLand!

This is a [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/) staticly-generated site. It is Ruby based with `erb` syntax and conventions familiar to Ruby on Rails developers.

### Getting Started

```bash
git clone git@github.com:code-newbies/codeland.git
cd codeland
```

```ruby
# Install the Middleman Ruby gem (You may need to install Ruby other environment prerequisites)
gem install middleman
    
# Initialize middleman, just needs to be run once.
middleman init
    
# Start middleman server.
middleman server
    
# Compile source files to build files (Optional for contribution purposes)
middleman build
```

### Where to find stuff

All files to modify are located in the `source` directory. These are the basis for the generated files which live in the project root.

Within the source directory are various pages, partials, and assets which are compiled to their static production versions.
