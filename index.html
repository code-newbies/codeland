        <div class="speaker-title"><strong>Belecia Bullock</strong>, Founder & Technical Interview Coach at TechUp Coaching</div>
        I am a technical interview coach and CS graduate student who loves to create through code and support women in their tech careers! After completing 40+ technical interviews during my undergraduate career and working with women at my college doing the same, I started TechUp Coaching to help more women confidently approach their technical interviews. Outside of coaching, I am also a graduate student whose research combines HCI, CS education and CS ethics to improve fairness and equity within technology!

She speaks frequently at international conferences about software design, distributed computing, site reliability engineering, and lots more topics, but her strongest passion is making the tech industry more accessible to other people with non-linear backgrounds. In her spare time, she runs events and creates art that uses doodles to explain technical concepts: deniseyu.io/art.
