<p>At the end of this workshop, you will walk away knowing how to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Query data using simple SELECT and WHERE clauses</li>
  <li>Perform table JOINs</li>
  <li>Be able to think about performance, by using the EXPLAIN clause.</li>
  <li>Read and understand SQL documentation</li>

<p>Workshop participants will learn an organized system for working on a small project while presenting best-practices. That means passing more interview steps, more options to choose from, and more bargaining power for your next job.</p>

          <div class="speaker-bio"><p>The web standard includes many APIs for an increasing range of tasks: controlling bluetooth, managing files, handling the clipboard… Some of them are more “serious,” and some of them are more “fun.” The Gamepad API falls in this last category.</p>

<p>It opens a world of possibilities for gaming by providing a different way to play games on the browser and by giving control to the users and creators. And its potential goes beyond gaming: adapted controllers could be used by people with disabilities, widening the possibilities and improving their access not only to games but to the Internet in general.</p>

<p>In this workshop we will introduce the Gamepad API, explore how it works, and use it to build a game with HTML and JavaScript that can be played on the browser with a connected game controller.</p>

          <div class="speaker-bio"><p>The most common myth about technical interviews is that they only focus on your coding ability! In reality, technical interviews are about showing how your story and professional experiences will add value to a potential company, team and/or role. Translation: you need to highlight both your technical and soft skills to stand out from the pack!</p>

<p>In this workshop, you will craft your story by 1) identifying the key skills recruiters are looking for at each stage of the interview process, 2) creating a memorable 30-second elevator pitch, 3) developing examples that show (and not just tell) the value you can add beyond your resume and 4) learning a framework that highlights your thought process during coding questions! Get ready to define and share #YourTechStory.</p>

<p>When you’re speaking to clients, upper management, elected officials, the general public, etc., it’s a problem if they can’t understand what you’re saying and don’t know how they’re supposed to respond. How do you simplify your presentations without talking down to your audience? How do you get people to take the actions you want? And how can you present effectively during a virtual meeting?</p>

<p>Presentation Skills for Brainiacs gives you the tools you need to develop understandable presentations that inspire your audiences to take action!</p>

              <span class="flare" style="background-color: #DFD4FC">workshop</span>

          <div>Hosted by: Kevin Zurawel</div>
          <br>
          <div class="speaker-bio"><p>When Nintendo released the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in the US in 1985, it quickly dominated the home video game market. Production of the NES ended in 1995, but it continues to be a popular platform, with several successful Kickstarter campaigns to fund the development of new NES games. Games for the NES are programmed in assembly, an extremely low-level programming language that gives the developer full control over the underlying hardware, but requires knowledge of how that hardware works. This means that learning assembly gives you insight into how computers in general interpret and execute programs, which can be applied to programming challenges in any other language.</p>

<p>In this workshop we will explore assembly development for the NES in a modern context, using emulators to run the games that we will develop. By the end of the workshop, you'll be able to draw graphics to the screen and handle input from the controller, and you'll have plenty of resources to continue learning on your own.</p>

They may never see your great portfolio, brilliant projects on Github, or glowing LinkedIn endorsements if they don't like what they see in 90 seconds.
