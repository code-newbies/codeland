## CodeLand!

This is a [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/) staticly-generated site. It is Ruby based with `erb` syntax and conventions familiar to Ruby on Rails developers.

### Getting Started

```ruby
    gem install middleman
    middleman init
    middleman server
    middleman build
```

### Where to find stuff

All files to modify are located in the `source` directory. These are the basis for the generated files which live in the project root.

Within the source directory are various pages, partials, and assets which are compiled to their static production versions.
