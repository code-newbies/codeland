        <p>We're the kindest, most inclusive, most supportive community of programmers

        food, and plenty of breaks to make new coding friends.</p>

        <h5>Inspiring Talks</h5>
        <p>Hear inspiring stories from speakers of
        all backgrounds and skill levels. We spend an average of 4hrs with each
        speaker to make sure they're ready for the big day, and you get to hear
        high-quality talks.</p>
