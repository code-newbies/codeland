        The magic of CodeLand lies in our fantastic talks from a diverse group of speakers &mdash; from the CodeNewbie Community and beyond! No two talks will be alike, but together, theyâ€™ll be inspiring and packed with practical information.

        The CodeLand call-for-proposals is open from March 1 to March 29, 2022. Our program committee looks forward to reviewing your talk geared at inspiring and educating early-career software developers and their champions.
