        The magic of CodeLand lies in our fantastic talks from a diverse group of speakers – from the CodeNewbie Community and beyond! No two talks will be alike, but together, they’ll be inspiring and packed with practical information.

        Our Call for Proposals (CFP) has now closed. We're now hard at work reviewing proposals to craft a fantastic CodeLand 2021 program! If you submitted a proposal, we'll be getting back to you by <strong>August 17.</strong>
